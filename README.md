Machine Learning in Bioinformatics with Python

Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project for classifying breast cancer cases as malignant or benign. The project uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and demonstrates the application of machine learning in bioinformatics using Python.

Repository Contents

LogisticRegression.m: An implementation of logistic regression in MATLAB.

README.md: This document provides an overview of the project.

breast-cancer-wisconsin.data: The raw dataset downloaded from the UCI repository.

breast-cancer-wisconsin.names: The description file for the dataset.

code.py: Python script containing the complete workflow for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

data.csv: The preprocessed dataset.

Workflow

This project follows a structured pipeline, as outlined below:

1. Machine Learning in Bioinformatics With Python

The project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to analyze bioinformatics data, specifically focusing on cancer classification.

2. Downloading Data From the UCI Repository

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

3. Preprocessing of the Data

The raw dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including:

Handling missing values.

Normalizing and scaling the features.

Encoding categorical labels.

4. Features & Labels

The dataset is split into:

Features: Predictors used for classification.

Labels: The target variable (malignant or benign).

5. Training & Testing of the Models

A logistic regression model is trained using the scikit-learn library. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance.

6. Pickling

The trained model is serialized using Python's pickle module, enabling the saving and reloading of the model for future predictions.

7. Making Predictions With Trained Models

The saved model is used to make predictions on new or unseen data.
